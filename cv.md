## About Me

<p>For the last few months I have been trying to devote almost all my free time to learning html, css and javascript. Having tried it exclusively for fun, I was very interested. I found my guiding star. It is very important for me to follow the path of self-development, and I understand that in such an intensively developing industry like IT, I can do it every day.</p>  
<p>The greatest pleasure when you go from "I don’t understand what is happening here" to "hey, I think I understand how it works, try add it to my project." For the sake of this feeling, I am ready to absorb information like a sponge and make maximum efforts to achieve my main goal - to find work as a junior frontend developer, in which RS School helps me a lot.</p>

    else
      return rgbVal
               .toString(16)
               .padStart(2,'0')
